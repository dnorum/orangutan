English-law principle of "that which is not forbidden is allowed" - I've found
nothing against their use here, with citation, and if informed of such will move

Furthermore, individual elements of this project have been greatly informed by
questions and answers posted on StackOverflow and various other places
accessible to Google. So thanks, y'all. Extended cognition and the hive mind
FTW.
