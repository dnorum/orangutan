# 0.2.0-alpha Targets:
- Add docstrings where appropriate throughout `librarything`, `plotting`, and `postgres`.
- Add standalone scripts for common tasks.
- Write up instructions (limited to the scripts in `orangutan` proper, setting up the environment with `psql`, `python`, etc. will still be BYOB.
- Add `surface` sub-package to support plotting and prepare for clustering in future versions.

# 0.3.0-alpha Targets:
- Expand plotting support to remove current kludges.
- Add fitting, however crude and kludgey the implementation may be.
